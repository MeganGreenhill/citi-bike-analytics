# Citi Bike Analysis Report
## Introduction
Analysis was performed on a dataset outlining use of Citi Bikes in February 2022, and Tableau was used to create visualisations and a story to present this analysis.

The analysis considered the following questions:
* In Feb 2022, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
* In Feb 2022, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?
* In Feb 2022, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
* In Feb 2022, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?

## Analysis
### Stations Used for Starting Journeys
Using Tableau, bar charts were created to highlight the top 10 and bottom 10 stations used for starting journeys. These stations were also mapped onto a map of New York with a colour gradient utilised to identify the most used and least used starting stations.
The most popular starting station was seen to be Grove Street Path with 1635 rides commenced here. This may be due to the many bike trails in the area, or because the station is very close by to two subway stations on Christopher Street and 9th Street.
The least popular starting station was at Grant Avenue and MLK Drive, with merely 15 rides commencing here. This station is located in Jersey City, which is less populated that New York. Additionally, the bike station does not have many bike trails surrounding it, making it less desirable to obtain a bike in this area.

### Stations Used for Ending Journeys
Using Tableau, bar charts were created to highlight the top 10 and bottom 10 stations used for ending journeys. These stations were also mapped onto a map of New York with a colour gradient utilised to identify the most used and least used ending stations.
The most popular ending station, like the starting station, was seen to be Grove Street Path with 1782 rides ending here. This is likely for the same reasons that it was the most popular starting station, outlined above. The least popular ending station was also Grant Avenue and MLK Drive, with only 13 rides ending here. Once again, this station was likely the least popular ending station for the same reasons it was the least popular starting station, due to it being located in Jersey City in an area with very few bike trails surrounding it.
